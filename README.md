# doshare
A simple white board to share text over your network.

I found it useful sometimes :).


Meteor made it really simple.

##### How to use:
just run `meteor` from app folder to start the app and leave it in the background, once the app is running you can access it anywhere on your network by accessing the machine's ip on port 3000.
